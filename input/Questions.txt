When using ER diagram to capture many-to-one relationship, which entity should the arrow point to?
What is a database?
What does a rectangle in an ER diagram represent?
Not all entity sets need to have keys.
You use a rounded arrow in an ER diagram to point to an entity set when you want to:
A key in an entity set may only have one attribute.
You can use referential integrity constraint in a many-to-many relationship.
A weak entity set always has referential integrity with the supporting entity set.
We use subclasses in ER diagrams when:
Using the NULL approach when mapping subclass to relational schema, 
When mapping ER diagram to relational schema, a subclass can be converted into relational schema using:
When mapping ER diagram to relational schema, a weak entity set's supporting relationship becomes:
When mapping ER diagram to relational schema, a many-to-many relationship becomes:
Given E->G, GC->D, we infer that EC->D.
If relational schema is not properly formulated, the following anomalies may occur:
Given that M->C, MC->E, ME->B, we infer that M->B.
Why do anomalies occur in tables?
With respect to the definition of functional dependency given in the lecture, an empty table satisfies all functional dependencies in the table.	
A candidate key is a key.
Primary keys and secondary keys are not candidate keys.
To prove that X->Y does not hold, we only need to show that {X}+ does not contain Y.
A key is a set of attributes in a table that decides some other attributes.
If {A}+ = {A, B, C}, then A->C.
If the closure of a set A of attributes contains all attributes in table R, then A might be a key (or superkey) of R.
