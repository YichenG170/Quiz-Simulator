    "correct": "B",
    "type": "single",
    "explanation": "Okun's Law states that a 1 percentage point increase in cyclical unemployment is associated with a 2 percentage point increase in the output gap. Therefore, a 2 percentage point increase in cyclical unemployment increases the gap by 4 percentage points."

    },
    "correct": "B",
    "type": "single",
    "explanation": "The negative coefficient on r (-200r) means that as the real interest rate increases, consumption decreases, likely because higher rates make saving more attractive and borrowing for consumption more expensive."
