    "options": {
      "A": "Saving is a stock variable, wealth is a flow variable",
      "B": "Saving is a flow variable that changes the stock of wealth",

      "D": "Wealth is a flow variable that determines saving"
    },
    "correct": "B",
    "type": "single",
    "explanation": "Saving is a flow measured over time (like income), while wealth is a stock measured at a point in time. The flow of saving causes changes in the stock of wealth."

      "D": "National saving is positive"

    "options": {
      "A": "Supply of saving increases, interest rates fall",

      "D": "Both supply and demand increase equally"
    },
    "correct": "B",
    "type": "single",
    "explanation": "Government deficits reduce national saving, shifting the supply curve leftward, which increases equilibrium interest rates and crowds out private investment."
